- Drafted the always-on mic pause detection pipeline + implementation plan under `projects/always-on-mic`, including remote app, OpenClaw trigger, and coordination notes.
- Created `scripts/pause-trigger.sh` to ingest pause-event JSON and forward transcripts to `openclaw prompt` with metadata.
- Added `projects/always-on-mic/tasks.md` capturing completed work and outlining next steps on the Debian host (FastAPI listener, safety/rate-limiting, skill documentation, delivery hook, end-to-end test).
