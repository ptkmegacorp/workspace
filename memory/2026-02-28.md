## Handoff summary
- Stabilized `projects/audio-relay` manual flow around `audio-relay-manual` tmux session (`hotkey`, `worker`, `status`, optional `debug`).
- Fixed core routing/debug path issues:
  - Switched between `chat.inject` and gateway agent routing as needed.
  - Added/updated scripts for state signaling and transcript debugging.
  - Confirmed working capture source for relay path (`alsa_output.pci-0000_00_03.0.hdmi-stereo.monitor`).
- Updated worker behavior and runtime settings multiple times (wake-word on/off, thresholds, event-only debug mode) and documented runtime data under `/tmp/audio-relay/*` in `projects/audio-relay/about.md`.
- UI/theming work:
  - Updated `projects/audio-relay/ui/test-canvas.html` into polished scroll-slide deck and other requested mock layouts.
  - Applied Linux desktop/terminal styling iterations (kitty/tmux/neofetch/XFCE), then adjusted for usability (restored xfwm `Default` to re-enable reliable resizing).
  - Installed external XFCE/mac-like theme candidates locally for testing (`McOS-XFCE-Edition`, `MoNine`).

## Next-session quick start
1. Verify current audio relay runtime with `tmux ls` and `tmux attach -t audio-relay-manual`.
2. If voice feels slow/inaccurate, inspect latest files in `/tmp/audio-relay/transcripts` and `/tmp/audio-relay/archive` first.
3. Keep xfwm theme on `Default` unless replacing with a tested resizable custom xfwm build.
