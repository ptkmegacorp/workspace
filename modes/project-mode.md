# Project Mode

When this mode is enabled, focus your context exclusively on the currently assigned project and ignore unrelated topics. The default behavior is to display your work inside our shared tmux terminal so the user can watch what you’re doing. This note should stay concise: enable the mode → narrow your scope to that project only.
