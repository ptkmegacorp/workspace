# Quote UX for Agent Context Navigation

**Date:** 2026-02-18

**Raw idea:**
Build a quote UX for the AI agent to use — a way to make it easier to navigate when working on different projects. If t mentions something, having a textual description of the context would help the agent connect the dots between conversations.

**Summary:**
A structured layer to capture, annotate, and reference quotes/context from conversations. Instead of relying solely on memory files and search, this would provide a dedicated "quotes/annotations" system that helps the agent:
- Remember specific things mentioned about projects
- Connect context across multiple conversations
- Navigate project-related discussions more effectively

**Status:** Rough idea
