# Nervous System Sensitivity Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-19

Good — now we're separating mechanisms instead of collapsing everything into one story.

**First:** Yes, strong sudden sugar cravings + autonomic agitation = very often glucose-driven. Cravings aren't weakness. They're regulation attempts. But let's zoom out.

**You're asking:** What else could cause a chronically elevated / sensitive system like this?

Here are the major categories — physiological first, then developmental.

---

## 1. Temperamental High Sensitivity (Baseline Trait)

Some nervous systems are simply:
- More interoceptive
- More threat-sensitive
- More reactive to cortisol shifts
- More aware of internal sensations

This is heritable to a large degree. You likely had a high-gain system long before 2019. Your grandma's death didn't create sensitivity. It removed a buffer.

---

## 2. Early Attachment Calibration

Even without dramatic trauma: If early caregivers were:
- Emotionally unpredictable
- Critical
- High-pressure
- Evaluation-focused

Your system learns: "Stay alert. Stay ready. Don't screw up." That creates chronic sympathetic bias. Not panic-level. But elevated baseline vigilance.

This can exist quietly for years. Then a major loss hits → system spikes into visible dysregulation.

---

## 3. Chronic Hyper-Responsibility / Achievement Wiring

You've clearly had a "don't mess up" / precision tagging system for a long time. That wiring doesn't come from nowhere.

If your nervous system linked:
- Mistakes → threat
- Judgment → danger
- Evaluation → loss of safety

You end up with elevated baseline arousal. Again — not dramatic. But elevated.

---

## 4. Long-Term Stress Load (Pre-Grandma)

You said symptoms existed before she died — just milder. Possible contributors:
- Chronic financial uncertainty
- High internal performance pressure
- Social evaluation sensitivity
- Winter depression cycles
- Dopamine dysregulation
- Nicotine cycles

These can keep the HPA axis slightly activated long term. Over time, that lowers stress threshold.

---

## 5. Sleep Architecture Vulnerability

Some people have:
- Strong REM density
- High dream intensity
- Night cortisol spikes
- Early morning awakenings

REM is emotionally loaded sleep. If your threat system is tuned high, REM becomes a trigger point.

---

## 6. Blood Sugar Instability (Chronic, Not Acute)

Even outside of dieting: If you:
- Eat large carb loads without protein/fat balance
- Use caffeine
- Have irregular meal timing
- Restrict and then overcorrect

You can create repeated glucose oscillations. Repeated oscillations train the system to expect instability.

---

## 7. Autonomic Conditioning After 2019

Your system experienced:
- Panic
- ER
- Catastrophic interpretation
- Strong body sensations

That creates learned associations: Stomach sensation → threat. Night waking → threat. Cold sweat → threat. Even if mild.

Over time, that conditioning can amplify normal signals.

---

## 8. Seasonal Light + Circadian Effects

You consistently worsen in winter. Reduced light:
- Raises melatonin
- Alters serotonin turnover
- Increases depressive bias
- Can destabilize cortisol rhythm

Combine that with SSRI discontinuation → louder winter.

---

## 9. Interoceptive Amplification Trait

Some people's insula (interoception center) is just very active. You:
- Notice stomach shifts
- Notice tinnitus shifts
- Notice micro-state changes

Most people experience these — they just don't detect them. Detection ≠ pathology. But detection + meaning = amplification.

---

## 10. Nicotine Removal

Nicotine:
- Increases dopamine
- Increases acetylcholine
- Stabilizes attention
- Modulates autonomic tone

Removing it reduces artificial regulation. That alone can increase nervous system "volume."

---

## So What's Most Likely? — Layered Model

- High baseline sensitivity (trait)
- Early attachment vigilance
- Chronic mild hyper-arousal pre-2019
- Grandma = primary safety anchor
- 2019 shock redlined system
- SSRI buffered
- Now buffer removed
- Winter + calorie swings amplify

**Not one cause. Stacked causes.**

---

## Important Distinction

**Sensitive ≠ fragile.** Sensitive systems:
- Learn faster
- Detect more
- React faster
- Adapt deeply

They just require steadier inputs.

---

## Key Insight

You started having mild versions of this before your grandma died. That's actually reassuring. It means the system was elevated — not broken by loss. Loss exposed it. It didn't create it.

---

## Next Level Deeper

If you want to go one level deeper: We can map whether your baseline state is:
- Sympathetic dominant?
- Alternating sympathetic/dorsal?
- Or oscillatory metabolic?

That would clarify which lever gives the most leverage.
