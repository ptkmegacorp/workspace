# AI in Every Home: The Local-First Revolution

The future of AI isn't in the cloud — it's in your house.

Think back to when Bill Gates famously envisioned "a computer in every home." Sounded crazy then. Now every pocket has more compute than those early PCs.

We're at that same inflection point with AI.

Here's the case for local AI boxes:

**1. Privacy**
Your conversations, your photos, your life — they stay on your hardware. No server in some data center reading your thoughts. Ever.

**2. Speed**
No round-trip to a server. No latency. No "sorry, try again" when the API is down. Your AI is always there, instantly responsive.

**3. Ownership**
You own the model. You own the data. You can audit the weights, fine-tune it, or swap it out. You're not locked into someone else's terms of service.

**4. Reliability**
Local-first means your AI works when the internet doesn't. Power outage? No problem. Dead spot? Still works. Your AI becomes as reliable as your lights.

**5. The Principle**
This is about digital sovereignty. The same way you own your laptop, you should own your AI. Not rent access to someone else's.

We're not talking about replacing cloud AI entirely — we're talking about having a personal AI that lives with you, knows you, and works for you.

The home computer revolution happened in the 80s. The smartphone revolution happened in the 2000s.

The local AI revolution is happening now.
