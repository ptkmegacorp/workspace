# AI Safety Campaign

## The Tsunami is Coming

AI is coming like a tsunami wave — and just like the personal computer revolution of the 80s and the smartphone revolution of the 2000s, the homes of tomorrow will need to be ready.

## Our Mission

We're spreading the word about the importance of:

1. **Having AI in every home**
   - Just like personal computers became household essentials
   - Just like smartphones became our constant companions
   - AI assistants will be everywhere

2. **Owning your hardware outright**
   - Don't rent your computing power
   - Own the machine that powers your AI
   - Keep it local, keep it yours

3. **Owning your software outright**
   - Open source AI models you can run yourself
   - No subscription fees for essential tools
   - Your data stays on your hardware

## The Wave is Coming

AI isn't slowing down — it's accelerating. The question isn't *if* AI will be in every home, but *who* will control it.

- Will it be tech giants renting you access?
- Or will it be you, in your own home, running your own AI?

## Join the Wave

We're not anti-cloud AI — we're pro-choice. Have both: a personal AI that lives with you, knows you, works for you — AND cloud AI for when you need the full internet's power.

But first, you need to own the hardware. You need to own the software.

**The home computer revolution happened in the 80s.**
**The smartphone revolution happened in the 2000s.**
**The local AI revolution is happening now.**

Who's with us?
