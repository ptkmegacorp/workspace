# Auto Carwash Project - Pine Island, MN

## Project Overview

**Location:** Pine Island, MN (Pop. 3,769)  
**Opportunity:** No carwash in town. Residents drive 10 min to Zumbrota or 15 min to Rochester.

## Business Model Options

| Type | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Self-Service** | Lower equipment cost, simpler operations | Labor-intensive, slower, weather dependent |
| **Automatic** | Higher throughput, can run unmanned, consistent revenue | Higher initial investment, more complex maintenance |

## Recommendation
**Automatic car wash** - Better for unmanned operation, higher margins, works in MN weather.

## Market Opportunity
- ~3,800 residents + surrounding area (draw from 10-15 min radius)
- Rochester has ~120,000 people - potential spillover from south
- No local competition = captured market

## Next Steps
1. Equipment research (Mark VII used units ~$12K-30K)
2. Site selection & zoning
3. Construction requirements
4. EPA/environmental compliance
5. Financial projections
