## Title: Own Your Computer, Own Your AI

---

**Hi guys, my name is tanner**

**And recently I started using my "lil tanner" — my AI helper.**

**He lives on my computer at home.**

**We communicate via my messaging app.**

Most of the time we use voice, but sometimes I just send him texts of what I need him to do.

## Example: Ordering Pizza

**Lil tanner helps me order pizza.**

*Im typically too lazy to type out the entire message...*

## How It Works

1. **Lil tanner** goes to a public directory and finds a list of pizza providers
2. He picks one of the pizza guys and asks for their menu
3. The pizza guy also has a **lil AI helper** — "pizza guy's lil AI helper"
4. Pizza guy's lil AI helper provides the menu to lil tanner
5. Lil tanner shows me the menu options and I tell him which one I want
6. Lil tanner talks to pizza guy's lil AI helper and tells them what we want
7. I wait for the pizza to come 🍕

## Why This Matters

This is a lot simpler than using something like DoorDash.

Having lil tanner around has made it really simple and easy to have whatever I usually do with my phone — just done for me.

- **No more scrolling crappy websites**
- **No more cookie banners**
- **No more Uber surcharges**

## The Bigger Picture

We spent **40 years** putting buttons on a screen.

And now all of that is going to go away.

> **We need to own the computer.**
> **We need to own the AI on the computer.**

*This is the future. Simple. Direct. Human.*
